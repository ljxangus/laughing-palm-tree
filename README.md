# laughing-palm-tree (Training Bots Code)

This is the code I get from the Traning Bot's LXC image.
* The Traning Bots' GNURadio Flowgraph for multiple SRNs to transmit things together
* Some json files for configuring the behaviour of SRNs.
* [TODO] It seems that they use the self-written GNURadio block called spectrum_challenge, I will find a way to get the code.
